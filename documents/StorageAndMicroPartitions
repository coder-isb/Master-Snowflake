1. **Format & Structure**:
   - Include a **title** and brief intro for the category.

   - Include **50 questions** with **plain-text answers**.
   - Use **Markdown headers** (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for questions).
   - Do **NOT** include SQL queries or code examples.
   - All questions/answers should be **expanded by default** (no collapsible sections).

2. **Content Requirements**:
   - Questions should cover **basics, advanced topics, best practices, performance tuning, and real-world considerations**.
   - Answers should be **clear, concise, and technical**, suitable for **senior developers or architects**.

3. **Sections Example** (adjust based on category):
   - Section 1: Basics / Fundamentals
   - Section 2: Architecture / Core Concepts

- Generate 50 questions with detailed answers as per the above rules.

**Instruction:**
