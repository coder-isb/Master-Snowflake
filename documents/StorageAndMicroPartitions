2. **Content Requirements**:
   - Questions should cover **basics, advanced topics, best practices, performance tuning, and real-world considerations**.
   - Answers should be **clear, concise, and technical**, suitable for **senior developers or architects**.
   - Include **practical explanations**, reasoning, and Snowflake-specific behaviors.

3. **Sections Example** (adjust based on category):
   - Section 1: Basics / Fundamentals
   - Section 2: Architecture / Core Concepts
   - Section 3: Advanced Features / Optimization
   - Section 4: Performance / Scalability
   - Section 5: Best Practices / Tips

4. **Formatting Guidelines**:
   - Use bullet points where needed.
   - Use bold text for key terms.
   - Maintain consistent numbering for questions (Q1…Q50).
   - Ensure readability and GitHub compatibility.

**Example Usage:**
- Replace `[CATEGORY_NAME]` with the category you want (e.g., "Storage & Micro-partitions", "Compute & Virtual Warehouses", "Cloud Services Layer", etc.).
- Generate 50 questions with detailed answers as per the above rules.

**Instruction:**  
“Generate a fully expanded README.md for Snowflake [CATEGORY_NAME] with 50 questions and answers, plain-text, GitHub-ready, without SQL queries, following the formatting and structure guidelines above.”

This 10-category structure will allow us to generate a full, end-to-end “Snowflake Bible”, covering 150–500 Q&A depending on depth per category.

If you want, the next step can be to create a Category 4 – Data Ingestion & Bulk Loading README.md in the same 50-question expanded format, fully consistent with the first three categories.

Do you want me to generate that next?

Add one more category for scenarios based interview questions covering -etl, elt, incremental load, on-prem tables to snowflake, migration best practices and add other imp areas
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! We can add a Category 11 – Scenario-Based & Advanced Use Cases. This will focus on practical, real-world scenarios, which are often used in senior-level interviews. It will complement the technical deep dives of the other categories by covering ETL/ELT strategies, migrations, incremental loads, on-prem integrations, and best practices.

Here’s a detailed structure:

Category 11: Scenario-Based & Advanced Use Cases
Scope / Topics Covered:

ETL vs ELT

Choosing between ETL and ELT in Snowflake

Pros/cons of each approach for large datasets

Incremental Load Strategies

Detecting changed data (CDC)

Using Streams and Tasks for incremental processing

Best practices for minimizing data movement

On-Premises to Snowflake Migration

Migrating from Oracle, SQL Server, Teradata, or other DWs

Handling large volumes of historical data

Data type mapping and schema conversion

Migration planning and execution strategies

Performance & Optimization in Real Scenarios

Handling large-scale ETL pipelines

Multi-table transformations and joins

Data modeling for high-performance queries
